# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse Projec** repository!
This project focuses on creating a structured and scalable data warehouse using SQL Server. The warehouse includes ETL processes which bring data from different sources, clean it, reshape it, and load it into the warehouse. It also uses data modeling techniques, such as star or snowflake schemas, to organize information into fact and dimension tables.
